Currently there is only one game in the repository so everyting noted here is about
the tic tac toe.

# Memo by Mazaalto

This is a tutorial project made by Leodanis Pozo Ramos and the original code is distributed under the MIT license.
I wanted to learn python and Tkinter and have a inital skeleton to build my own games. I would like to code Ben Orlin's
ultimate Tic tac toe from the book Math with Bad Drawings and I will use the tutorial in order to achieve results more quickly.
Thank you for the tutorial to Leodanis Pozo Ramos! The tutorial was nicely organized and after completing it I learned a lot about Tkinter!
The tutorial project was done in 5.12.2022.

# Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game With Python and Tkinter

This is the code for the Real Python tutorial [Build a Tic-Tac-Toe Game With Python and Tkinter](https://realpython.com/tic-tac-toe-python/). You learn to implement a tic-tac-toe game with Python and Tkinter. It allows two players to play a tic-tac-toe game on a shared device.

## Installation

The game uses Tkinter to build its user interface. Since Tkinter is part of the Python standard library, you don't need to install anything to run the game. Just make sure that you have a version of Tkinter greater than or equal to 8.6.

## Run the Game

To run the game, just execute the following command on your command line:

```sh
$ python tic_tac_toe.py
```
